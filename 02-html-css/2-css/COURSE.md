Recreate Piktology project

Notes:
- the project should be responsive
- the interns don't have to recreate the select language dropdown
- colored logo => completely white logo using just CSS (footer)
- simple image => image with a color overlay using just CSS (last section of the project)
- don't use offset columns (from Bootstrap)
- they can use empty columns for layout
- there should be only ONE single div with the class container
- the interns have to implement the carousel component from Bootstrap
- we don't have special assets for the carousel, they can use any images
- a carousel slide if comprised of image + title + description
- add an "on hover" effect for each slide of the carousel (play button)
- be careful on how to solve the responseviness of the footer

BONUS POINTS:
- add an "on hover" effect on each card in the section "Three distinct papers"
- add an "on hover" effect on each image in the gallery section ("Make it memorable")
